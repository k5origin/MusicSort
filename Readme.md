MusicSort v0.4

This program is designed to recursively scan a directory for a specific filetype and copies them all to an external storage location

PLEASE NOTE: The program is in beta and is currently hardcoded to search the entire 'D:\' directory for '.mp3' files and insert them into the 'D:\sorted directory'

Future versions of the program will include a method to choose a source folder, filetype, and destination within the console

USAGE: Press any key to start the program, press any key once it is finished to terminate the program
